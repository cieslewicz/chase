We are going to create a game together.

The characters in the game will be shapes with cartoony faces on then, just eyes, nose, moth.

The player will control the character they choose with arrow keys or mouse. The player will be able to move the character around the screen. 

The player will move their character to collect apples. The player will also avoid obstacles. There is also a "bad guy" character of the same size that will try to follow and catch the player. If the bad guy catches the player, the player will lose. The bad guy character will move progressively faster as the player's score increases.

The game will have a timer of 60 seconds. The player will lose if they run out of time.

The game will have a score. The player will gain points for collecting apples.

Apples will be worth 1 point. New apples will spawn in random locations every 2 seconds. Each apple will add 1 second to the time.

There is no penalty for colliding with obstacles.

The game will have a high score. The player will be able to save their high score locally.

The game will have a start screen. The player will be able to choose their character from 4 shapes (Circle, Square, Triangle, Star).

The game will have a game over screen. The player will be able to see their score and high score. The player will be able to restart the game or return to the start screen.

The game will have a settings screen. The player can adjust:
- Audio: Toggle sound effects on/off.
- Difficulty: Choose the number of obstacles (Easy: 5, Medium: 10, Hard: 20).
- Controls: Choose between Keyboard (Arrow keys/WASD) or Mouse (Follow cursor).
